# Network-Diagram-UI
The network diagram user interface is a graphical representation of a series of connected events. The user can analyze and determine the relationship of the activities involved in the network diagram.
The system is capable of storing and editing the information of the activities and displaying the graphical layout of the interconnected activities.When prompted, the program displays all paths or the critical path of the activities, and can create a text file listing the networkâ€™s path. If the paths are not connected, or are connected in a loop, the program will output error messages notifying the user that the paths are not in a valid network diagram formation.

In order to execute the network application, the JDK/JRE file for your operating system need to be installed.

When the application is launched, the user will be presented with the option to begin the first node of the network path. The user will click the location on the application of where to layout the first activity node. The user is presented with several options to control the network diagram, such as displaying or editing.
